**Problem**

Users often encounter difficulties when trying to keep track of books they want to read, have already read or are currently reading, especially when these books are scattered across various online platforms or are in different formats (e-books, audiobooks, physical books). Creating book lists or mantaining them can be challenging due to a lack of lack of a unified and organized system for tracking and managing reading materials.

**Solution**

BiblioBat is an app designed to solve the problem of scattered reading lists across various platforms. The app serves as a centralized digital bookshelf, allowing users to organize and track all their reads seamlessly, regardless of the format or platform. The focal point lies in predetermined categories and a search function so users have an easier time locating specific books and updating information. The design of the application has been tested and improved upon in a UX evaluation.
